RavProjectsWidget.htm takes Casey's RavelryThing function from the Ravelry.com API and formats the resulting JSON feed using CSS to work as a Blogger sidebar widget. I added borders to each project, and customized the font and background colors. Other users wanting to use this code would simply need to replace the API Callback with their Ravelry API key/and or modify the CSS to work with their personal website.
